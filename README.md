# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using XGBoost Classifier
January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month. Cervical Cancer is the 4th most common cancer in women, with a worldwide death rate of about 300,000.

The tumor develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the uterus from the vagina), and anybody with a cervix is at risk. HPV or the Human Papilloma Virus is a key factor that increases the risk of cervical cancer.

Other factors which contribute to the risk are having many children, smoking, and the presence of hormones in oral contraceptives.

Unlike most other forms of cancer, cervical cancer, if diagnosed early can be successfully treated and eliminated. A biopsy of the cervix is usually performed to confirm the presence of cancer.

By leveraging machine learning and AI, the presence of cervical cancer in a patient can be predicted, thereby dramatically improving early detection and diagnosis.

This project encapsulates building, training, and evaluating an XGBoost Classifier Model using data from 858 patients to predict their Biopsy results.
By leveraging machine learning and AI, cervical cancer can be dramatically reduced with early detection and diagnosis.

The dataset has been procured from Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Venezuela. I will first explore the dataset to understand what kind of information is provided. Following this, I will train an XGBoost classifier and evaluate its metrics.
